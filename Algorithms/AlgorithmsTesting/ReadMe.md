# Algorithm testing system, reading from text file with VBA

For the people, familiar with my blog, it is known that usually I am resolving problems from Codeforces.com. Codeforces supports plenty of languages, unfortunately VBA is not one of them. Thus, I have decided to build up a small algorithm testing system, which follows the following pattern – the input and the expected output are both provided via separate text files. Then, the person who writes the algorithm, should be able to write a function, reading from the first file and getting exactly the values from the other file.
Thus, let’s imagine that the task sounds like:
Take an input of 3 numbers and sum them. However, if the third number is even, do sum only the first two and subtract the third. 
This is easily achievable through this function (...)
