# VBA Personal

- Inititally the idea was to have a repository, for the `personal.xlsb`.
- Then it grew bigger. 
- Then I read an article about Hungarian Notation and I have decided to use it. 
- Then I read [what Joel thought about it and it](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2005/05/11/making-wrong-code-look-wrong/) and I have decided to abandon it completely. 
- Now (since 2018 or so) it is pretty much anything good that I write, that could be reused, so I do not have to reinvent the wheel every week. If I have to reuse it, I sometimes change the naming convention, avoiding the bad Hungarian notation and the `bad_naming_with_underscores_which_i_was_using_before`. 
- One day (probably never), when I have time I would group them in a better way.  
- Until then, I would use the search option.
- Feel free to do the same.
    
Good luck, have fun from [VitoshAcademy](http://www.vitoshacademy.com)

# VBA Boilerplate 

Building a boilerplate, which is to be used by as a start point for every VBA project was long in my mind. Somewhere in 2016 I have decided to put all the useful VBA code that I am using in a single repository. This repository currently resides here:
[https://github.com/VBoilerplate/Boiler](https://github.com/VBoilerplate/Boiler)

But it will slowly be migrating it back to this one. 
[https://github.com/VBA_personal/](https://github.com/VBA_personal/)

Keep on moving!
